# Deep Learning Approach on Music Recommendation System
## Overview
This project aims to develop a personalized recommendation system for Spotify tracks by leveraging artist and audio feature data. Using the Spotify Tracks (1921–2020) dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ektanegi/spotifydata-19212020), the goal is to analyze user preferences and suggest relevant songs through machine learning techniques. The initial phase focuses on data exploration and preprocessing, preparing the dataset for a neural network model that will learn patterns between artists and user interactions. Later stages will incorporate deep learning to generate high-quality recommendations using both collaborative and content-based filtering approaches.
## Features
The system will use key features from the dataset to drive recommendations. Artist names will be converted into numerical embeddings, allowing the model to recognize relationships between different musicians. Audio characteristics such as danceability, liveness, and acousticness will provide additional context about each track’s style. By combining these elements, the model can identify similarities between songs and predict which tracks a user might enjoy.
## Dataset
The dataset contains detailed information about each track, including a list of artists, numerical audio features, and metadata. The artists column includes one or more performers per track, which will be encoded for model training. Audio attributes like danceability (a score from 0 to 1), energy (intensity of the track), and duration_ms (song length) help define the musical profile of each entry. This structured data will serve as the foundation for training the recommendation model in later stages.
